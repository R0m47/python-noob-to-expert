## Level 14: Quiz Game (OOP)

In this level you will build a simple True/False quiz using object‑oriented programming. You’ll create three modules—`question_model`, `quiz_brain`, and `data`—and a small `main.py` runner.

**How to run:**

1. Create four files in the same folder: `data.py`, `question_model.py`, `quiz_brain.py`, and `main.py`.

2. Paste the code above into each file respectively.

3. Run the command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. Answer each question with `True` or `False` and track your score.

**Learning objectives:**

-Model domain entities with simple classes.
-Maintain and update state across method calls.
-Iterate through collections and handle user input.
-Separate data (questions), logic (quiz engine), and interface (main loop).
