## Level 18: Pong Game (OOP + Turtle)

Recreate the classic Pong arcade game using Python’s `turtle` graphics and OOP. Two paddles (controlled with `W/S` and arrow keys) bounce a moving ball, while a scoreboard keeps track of points.

**How to run:**

1. Create four files: `pong.py`, `paddle.py`, `ball.py`, `scoreboard.py`.

2. Copy the code above into each respective file.

3. Run:

   ```bash
   pong.py
   ```

4. Control the right paddle with `↑`/`↓` and the left paddle with `W`/`S`.

**Learning objectives:**

-Manage multiple classes to build a complete game.
-Handle real-time user input for two players.
-Implement collision mechanics and scoring.
-Adjust speed dynamically for increasing difficulty.
