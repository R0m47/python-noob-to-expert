## Level 15: Hirst Spot Painting (Turtle + Colorgram)

Recreate a Damien Hirst–style dot painting using Python’s `turtle` graphics. You’ll extract a color palette from an image with `colorgram`, then paint a 10×10 grid of colored dots.

**How to run:**

1. Install dependencies (only once):

   ```bash
   pip install colorgram.py
   ```

2. Place your source image at `Apprentice/level_15/hirst_spot_painting.jpg` (or adjust the path in create_color_list()).

3. Save the script as `hirst_spot_painting.py`.

4. Run the command:

   ```bash
   python hirst_spot_painting.py
   ```

**Learning objectives:**

-Use `colorgram` to extract an image color palette.
-Work with RGB tuples and `turtle.colormode(255)`.
-Practice movement and drawing primitives with `turtle`.
-Structure simple graphic programs with helper functions.
