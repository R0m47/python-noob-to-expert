## Level 24: Password Manager (Tkinter + JSON)

Build a password manager with a graphical interface. The app generates random secure passwords, saves them (along with email and website) into a JSON file, allows searching for stored credentials, and copies new passwords to the clipboard.

**How to run:**

1. Save this file as `password_manager.py`.

2. Place an image `logo.png` inside `Apprentice/level_24/`.

3. Run:

   ```bash
   python password_manager.py
   ```

4. Use Generate Password to create and copy a new password.
5. Use Add to save credentials to data.json.
6. Use Search to retrieve stored credentials for a website.

**Learning objectives:**

-Generate strong passwords programmatically.
-Save, update, and read JSON data files.
-Integrate clipboard operations for ease of use.
-Build a complete GUI tool with search, save, and error handling features.
