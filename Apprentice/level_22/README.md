## Level 22: Feet and Inches to Meters Converter (Tkinter GUI)

Build a simple GUI application that converts height in feet and inches into meters. The user enters values, clicks a button, and the result is displayed dynamically.

**How to run:**

1. Save the file as `feet_inches_to_meters.py`.

2. Run it with Python:

   ```bash
   python feet_inches_to_meters.py
   ```

3. Enter values in feet and inches, then click Calculate.

4. The equivalent length in meters will be displayed.

**Learning objectives:**

-Create a GUI with `tkinter`.
-Use entry fields and labels to display user input and output.
-Update the GUI dynamically with widget methods (`.config`).
-Apply math conversions with user-provided data.
