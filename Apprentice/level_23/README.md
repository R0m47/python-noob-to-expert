## Level 23: Pomodoro Timer (Tkinter GUI)

Create a productivity timer based on the Pomodoro Technique: 25 minutes of focused work, followed by short breaks, and a long break after four sessions.

**How to run:**

1. Save the script as `pomodoro_timer.py`.

2. Place the `tomato.png` image in the folder `Apprentice/level_23/`.

3. Run:

   ```bash
   python pomodoro_timer.py
   ```

4. Click Start to begin the timer. Use Reset to stop and clear progress.

**Learning objectives:**

-Schedule repeated events in Tkinter (`after`, `after_cancel`).
-Implement countdown timers with GUI updates.
-Manage application state with global variables.
-Provide user feedback with labels and symbols (âœ… for each completed work session).
