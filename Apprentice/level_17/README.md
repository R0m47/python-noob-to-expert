## Level 17: Snake Game (OOP + Turtle)

Build the classic Snake game using Python’s `turtle` module with a clean object-oriented design. You’ll split the program into three classes—`Snake`, `Food`, and `Scoreboard`—and a small `snake_game.py` runner. You’ll practice keyboard control, a simple game loop, and collision detection (food, walls, and self).

**How to run:**

1. Create four files in the same folder: `snake_game.py`, `snake.py`, `food.py`, `scoreboard.py`.

2. Paste each code block into its corresponding file.

3. Run:

   ```bash
   snake_game.py
   ```

4. Use the arrow keys to steer the snake, eat food to grow, and avoid walls and your own tail.

**Learning objectives:**

-Apply OOP to structure a small arcade game.
-Use a timed game loop with `screen.tracer(0)` and `time.sleep`.
-Detect collisions with objects and boundaries.
-Handle keyboard events to update movement direction.
