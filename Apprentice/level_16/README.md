## Level 16: Turtle Race (GUI)

Build a simple racing game using the `turtle` graphics module. The user places a bet on a turtleâ€™s color, then four turtles race across the screen, moving forward by small random distances each frame.

**How to run:**

1. Save the script as `turtle_race.py`.

2. Run the command:

   ```bash
   python turtle_race.py
   ```

3. Enter your color bet in the prompt and watch the race.

**Learning objectives:**

-Use `turtle` for simple 2D graphics and animation.
-Read user input from GUI prompts (`Screen.textinput`).
-Control multiple sprites (turtles) and their positions.
-Implement a game loop and determine a winner.
