## Level 5: Password Generator

In this level 5 project, you will create a secure, random password generator. You will learn to work with multiple data structures, pick random elements, shuffle lists, and join characters into a final string.

**How to run:**

1. Save this code in a file named `password_generator.py`.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the folder where you saved the file.
3. Run the command:

   ```bash
   python password_generator.py
   ```

4. Specify the number of letters, symbols, and numbers to generate your password.

**Learning objectives:**

- Import and use standard modules (`random`).
- Create and combine lists.
- Use `random.choices()` for random selection.
- Use `random.shuffle()` to mix elements.
- Convert a list of characters into a string with `"".join()`.
- Format output with f-strings.
