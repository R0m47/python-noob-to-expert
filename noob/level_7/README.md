## Level 7: Caesar Cipher

In this level 7 project, you will implement the Caesar Cipher, a classic cryptography technique that shifts each letter of the text a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

**How to run:**

1. Save this code in a file named `caesar_cipher.py`.
2. Make sure you have the module `caesar_cipher_art.py` with the variable `logo` in the same folder.
3. Open the terminal and navigate to the folder.
4. Run:

   ```bash
   python caesar_cipher.py
   ```

5. Follow the instructions to encrypt or decrypt messages.

**Learning objectives:**

- Define and call functions with multiple parameters.
- Use `for` loops to process strings.
- Use the `%` operator for cyclic shifting.
- Manage user input and validate options.
- Structure code into separate modules and files.
