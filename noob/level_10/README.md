## Level 10: Blackjack

In this level, you will implement the famous Blackjack (21) card game against the computer.

**How to run:**

1. Save this code in `blackjack.py` and create `blackjack_art.py` with the variable `logo`.
2. Run:

   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

3. Decide whether to draw more cards or stand, and compete against the house.

**Learning objectives:**

- Model game rules with functions (`deal_card`, `calculate_score`, `compare`).
- Detect Blackjack with a sentinel value (0) and manage Ace as 1/11.
- Implement the dealerâ€™s turn rules (hit until 17).
- Control the game cycle with while loops and user input.
- Separate art and logic into different modules.
