## Level 11: Number Guessing Game

In this level, you will implement a number guessing game between 1 and 100. The player can choose between two difficulty levels (easy and hard), which determine the number of available attempts.

**How to run:**

1. Save this code in a file named `number_guessing_game.py`.
2. Place the module `number_guessing_game_art.py` with the variable `logo` in the same folder.
3. Open the terminal and navigate to the fileâ€™s folder.
4. Run:

   ```bash
   python number_guessing_game.py
   ```

5. Choose the difficulty and start guessing the number.

**Learning objectives:**

- Define functions to modularize code.
- Use while loops and conditionals to control flow.
- Validate user inputs.
- Clear the console according to the operating system.
- Integrate ASCII art to enhance the interface.
