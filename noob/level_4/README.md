## Level 4: Rock, Paper, Scissors

In this level 4 project, you will develop the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game against the computer. You will learn to use external modules `(random)`, lists, indexing, input validation, and complex conditional structures.

**How to run:**

1. Save this code in a file named `rock_paper_scissors.py`.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the folder where you saved the file.
3. Run the command:

   ```bash
   python rock_paper_scissors.py
   ```

4. Enter 0, 1, or 2 to choose your move and play against the computer.

**Learning objectives:**

- Import and use functions from standard modules `(randint)`.
- Define and handle lists.
- Access list elements via indexing.
- Validate and handle invalid inputs.
- Implement game logic with multiple conditions.
